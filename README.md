# SpeechRepeat
Simple Python project that uses speech recognition and text to speech to repeat back what you say

The program is fairly straightforward. I wrote it to understand the text to speech and Speech Recognition modules

It listens to what you say, saves it as a string which is then input into the text to speech module and the text is played back to you.
There are multiple ways to playback the sound. I'm using playsound to do this as it is quite simple
